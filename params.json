If you are running tor in OSX via homebrew, then this app will work out of the box if you follow the install instructions below. Otherwise, you may have to edit your torrc file and (gosh!) actually use the terminal / command line / whatever you call it.\r\n\r\n### SECURITY ISSUES:   \r\nELECTRON has known security issues with using an unsandboxed version of chromium. The roadmap is to use the electron-prebuilt module from Brave browser since they re-sandboxed and fixed a lot of the security issues related to potential for XSS attacks.\r\n\r\n### FORK ME:   \r\nPlease fork and make this better.   \r\nREAD the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jamesacampbell/elector/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc for tips on how to help with this project. Thank you!\r\n\r\nhere is how to run it yourself:\r\n\r\n###Install instructions\r\n\r\n1. you must have tor already installed. follow the instructions from torproject.org\r\n\r\n2. then to run this code, follow these steps:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/jamesacampbell/elector.git\r\ncd elector\r\nnpm install -d\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\n### tidbits:\r\n\r\nThe index.js file is configured to force the connection through the socks5 proxy 127.0.0.1:9050. So for OSX you can install tor via homebrew:\r\n\r\n_in case you don't have tor install on OSX yet_\r\n\r\n### OSX & homebrew easiness to get Tor installed as a service:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install tor\r\n```\r\nthen make sure tor is set to run when your OS starts, then check duckduckgo onion (http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion) site to confirm it is working\r\n\r\n### useful .onion links\r\n\r\nduck duck go http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion\r\n\r\ntor paste http://mc6nld3smffo3vgm.onion\r\n\r\nnot evil tor search http://hss3uro2hsxfogfq.onion\r\n\r\nhidden wiki http://gxamjbnu7uknahng.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\r\n\r\nhidden answers http://answerstedhctbek.onion\r\n\r\nlibrechan http://librechbtnnmzoa7.onion\r\n\r\nsearx http://ulrn6sryqaifefld.onion\r\n\r\netherpad hosted by riseup onion http://5jp7xtmox6jyoqd5.onion\r\n",
